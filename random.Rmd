Life forms are not separate from their environment, they are one in the same.
Life is an emergent property of an environment and an environment is configured in the shape of life.
I make a distinction here between an organism and the continual process of life, which is not restricted to a species, population, or ecosystem.
The continuation of life through time is like a wave and the enviroment is like the medium the wave passes through.
The wave is a specific configuration of the medium, not seperate from the medium.
A wave without a medium is an abstract idea with no foundation in reality.
Even the abstract notion of a wave is a self-propigating meme in the medium of human culture. 
Yet, we think of a bird or species of bird as something distinct; something we can take a sample of and immortalize in a museum.
That is nothing but an idea, not a bird, not life; it is like a wave in frozen water.
You can place a population of birds in a cage, but they cannot be maintained any more than you can maintain an piece of a tsunami in an aqaurium.
The human species is building its own cage with the assumption that we are seperate from nature.
We build that cage around all the life forms we encounter and they will diminish with us like waves in an aquarium. 


Some people use their intellect like a spear to catch a fish. 
They are efficient, precise and either hit their mark or not.
They work best when they know what they seek; their problem must be defined. 
Others use thier intellect like a net and throw it in the general direction of a problem. 
They have to search through more water and what they seek might escape.
However, they may come across treasures unlooked for.
