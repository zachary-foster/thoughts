## R function to make a flashcard presesntation from a markdown file

This would take a markdown file and break it up into pairs of slides constituting "flashcards".
The file would be broken up based on a specificed level of heading (1 = "#", 2 = "##", etc).
The first slide of each pair would be the the title of the heading and the second would display the content below the heading.
