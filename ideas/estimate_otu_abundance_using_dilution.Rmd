OTU abundance cannot be estimated reliably from read abundance due to numerous biases. 
However, I wonder if it is possible to estimate abundance by sequenceing the same sample multiple times over a range of dilutions. 
Highly diluted samples should only contain the most abundant OTUs. 
A proxy for abundandance could then be the number of the dilutions that a OTU was observed in. 
This might have the same biases as the read count... not sure.
