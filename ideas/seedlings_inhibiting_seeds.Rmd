# Does the presence of seedlings inhibit seed production?

In plants that produce seed that is not widly dispersed I would expect that there would be an evolutionary benifit to not producing addional seed if seedlings are near the parent plant or perhaps related plants.
This would be most pronounced in plant that continually produce seed over a long period of time during which those same seeds germinate. 
This might have an effect on fruit/grain yeilds in high density monoculture.
If this occurs only between related plants, polyculture might be able to have a higher overall yield.
