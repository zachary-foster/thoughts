ARISA (Automated ribosomal intergenic spacer analysis) is simply assessing "diveristy" (more accuratly, minimum richness), based on the ITS amplicon size distribution of fungi from a mixed sample (e.g. PCR of ITS in soil). 
Using a database of ITS sequences to estimate the relationship between amplicon length distribution and species richness,  could perhaps be used to estiamte that number of species/OTUs that will be sequenced in a metabarcoding experiment using the relativly cheap technique ARISA. 
This would allow for optimizing the amount of sequenceing done on a per-sample basis when multiplexing, preventing excessive sequenceing of low-divesristy samples.
